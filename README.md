# Coffee machine kata with DDD

## Introduction

This project implements the [coffee machine kata](https://simcap.github.io/coffeemachine/).

In theory, this kata implementation should be as simple as possible, but in this project besides learning how to do Outside-In TDD I also want to show a way to apply **functional programming, domain-driven design and hexagonal architecture** to solve a "real" problem, hence, the code is **not just a simple coffee machine kata**, architectural patterns and DDD building blocks will be used.

Please, **forgive me in advance**, I am developer mainly focused on JVM languages (kotlin, java, scala) and this is my first contact with dotnet ecosystem, therefore maybe I didn't follow some F# community conventions in terms of files, project, naming and so on ... but I did my best!
