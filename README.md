# Coffee machine kata with DDD

## Introduction

This project implements a [coffee machine kata](https://simcap.github.io/coffeemachine/) with Outside-In TDD but also applying
functional programming, domain-driven design and hexagonal architecture.

Please, **forgive me in advance**, I am developer mainly focused on JVM languages (kotlin, java, scala) and this is my first contact with dotnet ecosystem, therefore maybe I didn't follow some F# community conventions in terms of files, project, naming and so on ... but I did my best!
